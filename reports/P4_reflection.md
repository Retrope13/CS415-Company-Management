##What went well?
We comminicated well about the issues we were facing and regularly met up to check on progress. We were also able to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and overcome the initial comprehension issues we had regarding the creation of the tests for endpoints and were able to finish our implementations in a short period of time.

##What did not go well?
Alizee had some personal issues as well as being newly introduced to the group. We had some confusion about the tasks for our sprint towards the beginning, and this impeded our process throughout the sprint. We accidently created issues for creating endpoints that were already implemented in the code base. We also struggled with figuring out how to create tests for the endpoints initially which set back our overall development speed for this sprint.

##What can be improved?
Getting to know each other better through next sprint as well as start working on some of the work earlier on in the sprint rather than the last week. Next sprint we could also benefit from spending some time to find additional resources to help our understanding of the material if the documentation does initially answer all of our questions.
