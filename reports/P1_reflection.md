# Reflection Regarding Sprint One

## Sprint 1 (1/24/23 - 2/13/23)

### What went well:

- Communicating effectively via teams
- Division of labor
- Consistency in code practices and syntax
- The system of creating pull requests and reviewing them
- Our tests that we implemented were very simplistic because the logic of the methods we were testing weren't very intensive

### What didn't go well:

- Upon further reflection our team agrees that we could've begun work closer to the start of the sprint
- Unfortunately when assigning methods at the start of the sprint we failed to realize that some methods dependended on eachother
- In retrospect our team should've generated the ISP earlier in the sprint, but this was due to learning about it later in the sprint
- Because of prior engaments and illness our scrums were fairly inconsistent

### What we will do differently next sprint:

- We would like to construct a heirarchy at the beginning of the next sprint to discover method dependencies before assigning methods
- We will create the ISP table far earlier than we did this sprint to ensure a stronger test-driven development mind set
- We will have a more consistent meeting time for our scrums and weekly rundowns
- We should've looked harder at the UML diagram to have a more comprehensive understanding of the design requirements
