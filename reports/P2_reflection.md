# Sprint 2 Reflection
## (2/14/23) - (3/6/23)
### What Went Well
This sprint seems to have gone well. Our sprint planning was accurate and comprehensive so we didn’t have any substantial last minute changes. Team communication improved this sprint and the consistent weekly meetings kept the project on pace. We completed our ISP table much sooner in the process and so it was easy to create base choice coverage tests. There were less merge conflicts than last time and we were able to work efficiently in parallel for the majority of the time.
### What Didn't go Well
When it comes to improving, there are some areas to work on. It seems like our additions to the ISP table for the company class could have been better. It is likely that we missed a couple of characteristics since our base choice coverage didn’t land us at 100% in branch coverage. We tended to rely far more on Jacoco coverage and could focus more on the mutation results from PIT. Furthermore, some of our coverage issue may be caused by complicated if statement conditions which could probably be simplified.
### What We Will Do Differently Next Sprint
In sprint 3, we will:
- Make sure to allocate more time towards adding tests based off results from our mutation tests to hopefully reach 100% mutation test coverage in all the classes included in the model package.
- Refactor some of the complicated methods through the use of smaller private methods.
- Try to finish the main sprint tasks a few days earlier to catch missing branch coverage that may appear from fixes.
