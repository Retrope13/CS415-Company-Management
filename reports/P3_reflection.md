# Sprint 3 Reflection
## (3/7/23) - (3/27/23)
### What Went Well
We communicated well throughout the sprint.
### What Didn't go Well
The whole process. We needed to wait for feedback to fix the bugs. Then we spent a majority of the sprint fixing those, only to find out a few days before it was due that we no longer needed to fix our bugs. We then ran into several issues with running the tools. There wasn't a lot of information provided for static analysis tools. Clover was missing the plugin in the instructions. Evosuite only seemed to work on one of our computers, so we had to exclude it from our github repo. 
### What We Will Do Differently Next Sprint
In sprint 4, we will:
-Make sure there are no version descrepencies before running 3rd party tools.
-Complete more issues in the beginning of the sprint.
-Tackle some issues from the icebox.
