## Sprint 2 (2/14/23 - 3/6/23)
### Sprint Master
Lucas Kerr

### Sprint Planning
Epics to complete:
- Implement Company
- Fix Sprint 1 Errors (Depends on P1 feedback)

#### Sprint Requirements
In Sprint 2, the Company class will need to be implemented based on the design requirements from https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs415/2023sp/project/p1/p1.php. Class will need to be added to the Input Space Partitioning table, and base choice coverage will be used to create test based on the blocks from the characteristics that were identified.
