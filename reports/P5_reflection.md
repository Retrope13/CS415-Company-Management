##What went well? 
We communicated well about the issues we were facing and regularly met up to check on progress. Most of the work was done earlier in the sprint, unlike last time. We did not have too many issues implementing the frontend, and planned our issues well together.

##What did not go well?
Some of us did not have much experience with react and frontend coding, so there was a learning curve in trying to understand how to implement some of the tasks. Additionally, the DTOs were a mismatch, causing confusion. This took us considerable time to resolve.

##What can be improved?
The DTOs were a big issue. Implementing those differently would have helped us considerably this sprint. Additionally, having more experience in frontend coding after this sprint would really help in future work in improving the user interface.
